Hello World Bye World How are you What is your name 
I study Spark and also Hadoop
I prefer Spark to Hadoop
But I have to spend more hours studying Spark
Hadoop is difficult to compile and debug some say
But I am interested in MarReduce which is part of Hadoop
So what shall I choose
Perhaps I can compromise let's forget about it all and do SQL
But I am studying Cloud Computing
I am supposed to get familiar with Spark Hadoop NoSQL PigHive
and much much more
Oh forget it. I'll only do Hadoop as this is how it all started
No, don't I want to be more modern? Then I'd better study Spark
